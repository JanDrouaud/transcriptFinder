- [ ] Commit 5ccc063 of transcriptFinder.py is not memory economical: there is a peak of memory use, reaching 58 Gb, wich originate from a transcriptomic peculiarity : an assembly of several 10^5 alignments, around 20 Kb wide and 35000 mean depth-of-coverage.
Consequently, the getGenomicAlns function has been slightly modified, so as to use less memory.
